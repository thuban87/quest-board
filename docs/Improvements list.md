## Dungeon issues checklist:
- HP is different between dungeon and character sheet. Need to make sure hp is normalized throughout entire plugin
-Need to define loot bias for each tileset
-Need to define monster pool for each dungeon
-Need to update dungeon template in settings (user created templates instructions) to use the new kebab naming convention for the monsters
-Need to make death options modal bigger. Currently if you click outside of it it closes the modal, effectively ending the dungeon.
-Need to finish AI dungeon generation tool for end user


## General issues checklist:
-Ability to rename columns headers in kanban view
-Button on completed column to archive the quests currently in that column. Would need to scan and move the correct ques files, probably leave the linked files alone
-Clean up settings menu. Need ot reorganize according to topic/subject and then put in a better order: more used items up top, less used below. Make sub menu modals where needed if possible.

## Mobile issues checklist:
