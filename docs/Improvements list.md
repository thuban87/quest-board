## Dungeon issues checklist:
- HP is different between dungeon and character sheet. Need to make sure hp is normalized throughout entire plugin
-Need to define loot bias for each tileset
-Need to define monster pool for each dungeon
-Need to update dungeon template in settings (user created templates instructions) to use the new kebab naming convention for the monsters
-Need to make death options modal bigger. Currently if you click outside of it it closes the modal, effectively ending the dungeon.
-Need to finish AI dungeon generation tool for end user


## General issues checklist:
-HP/Mana regen is spotty reward-wise on task completion. I'd say it's firing maybe 80% of the time
-Achievements:
    -Still getting multiple "First Quest" achievements. I'm definitely not on my first quest anymore so that's wrong to begin with. It appears the achievement just isn't saving properly

## Scrivener's quill checklist:
-Need more options on the create/update modal for quests in general
    -The example/demo frontmatter is confusing. It should reflect what the actual default frontmatter is and ideally allow for changing it.
    -Can we have a reading mode looking demo for the preview? The markdown version might not be for everybody. If we go this route, we should also allow for changing the default frontmatter in settings above the preview.
    -What is the point of the right column in the create/update modal? It's not editable and doesn't seem to do anything beyond saying "2 fields filled out" as you fill out fields. Seems useless.
-Daily quest not saving as daily, it's saving as a side quest. Still behaves the way I want it to by and large but not accurate and likely will cause issues.
