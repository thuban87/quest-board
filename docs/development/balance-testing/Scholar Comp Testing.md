## Level 20 Summary
- Almost unplayable in terms of dps. Arcane missle is a joke of a move that does non effective damage on nearly everybody. Need to swap the skill order so that the other dps moves come first and give a viable dps move
	- Should also consider adding types to the remaining monsters who are normal type
- Was able to finish forest ruins with a good amount of resource management. That part was fun enough but the above dps was frustrating to deal with

## Level 40 Summary
- DPS still seriously lacking. Apparently every move learned is arcane, which sucks for the most part. Need to revisit moves altogether
- Finished forest ruins after a death part-way. Serious resource management needed along the way
