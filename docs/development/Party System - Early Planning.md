🎮 PARTY SYSTEM BRAINSTORM - Quest Board Phase 4

  This is a fantastic idea! The Digimon disc mechanic you mentioned is brilliant - that sense of "what does THIS
  generate?" is super engaging. Let's design something similar but tied to your vault and productivity.

  ---
  💡 THE VAULT SCANNER (Digimon-Style Discovery)

  This is my favorite concept - your vault itself becomes the "disc" that generates companions.

  How It Works:

  COMPANION DISCOVERY SCANNER
  Analyze your vault to unlock hidden companions based on your note-taking patterns.

  [Scan Vault] Button

  Results:
  ═══════════════════════════════
  📊 Vault Statistics:
  - Total Notes: 487
  - Folders: 23
  - Daily Note Streak: 67 days
  - Most Common Tags: #work (143), #fitness (89), #learning (76)
  - Oldest Note: 3.2 years ago
  - Most Linked Note: "Project Hub" (156 backlinks)
  - Code Blocks Found: 234

  🎭 COMPANIONS DISCOVERED:
  ✅ The Archivist (Scholar) - UNLOCKED! [487 notes > 300]
  ✅ The Marathoner (Paladin) - UNLOCKED! [67-day streak > 60]
  ✅ The Networker (Bard) - UNLOCKED! [Note with 156 links > 150]
  ✅ The Coder (Technomancer) - UNLOCKED! [234 code blocks > 200]

  🔒 Still Locked:
  ❌ The Ancient One (Cleric) - Vault age: 3.2 years (Need: 5 years)
  ❌ The Completionist (Rogue) - Achievements: 18/32 (Need: 25/32)
  ❌ The Wordsmith (Bard) - Longest note: 4,823 words (Need: 10,000)

  [Recruit Available] [View All Companions]

  Why This Rules:
  - ✅ Unique to each user - Your vault patterns create YOUR companions
  - ✅ Discovery moments - "Holy crap, my vault unlocked The Ancient One!"
  - ✅ Rewards long-term use - Older vaults get rarer companions
  - ✅ Digimon nostalgia - Same "what does my data generate?" feeling
  - ✅ Manual scan - Active discovery, not passive notification spam

  🎯 PRIMARY ACQUISITION METHODS

  1. Category Mastery (Main Path)

  Concept: Each quest category has signature champions you unlock through specialization.

  FITNESS CATEGORY
  ════════════════
  XP Earned: 2,847 / 1,000 ✅
  Champion Unlocked: "The Athlete" (Warrior variant)

  Appearance: Muscular build, gym attire, protein shaker
  Backstory: "Former olympic hopeful who found purpose in coaching others"
  Bonus: +15% stats on Fitness category quests
  Special: "Second Wind" - Party regains 10% HP after Fitness quest completion

  Examples:
  - Work → "The Executive" (Paladin/Scholar hybrid)
  - Fitness → "The Athlete" (Warrior)
  - Learning → "The Professor" (Scholar)
  - Creative → "The Artist" (Bard)
  - Social → "The Diplomat" (Bard/Cleric)
  - Dev/Tech → "The Engineer" (Technomancer)
  - Admin → "The Organizer" (Rogue - efficiency specialist)

  Why: Clear, productivity-focused, rewards specialization.

  ---
  2. Boss Recruitment (RNG Excitement)

  Concept: 15% chance to recruit bosses/elites you defeat.

  VICTORY!
  You defeated "General Ackbad"!

  General Ackbad is impressed by your strength.

  "Perhaps I was fighting for the wrong side..."

  [Recruit to Party] [Let Him Go]

  Constraints:
  - Only works on Elite, Boss, Raid Boss tiers
  - 15% base chance (increases with Charisma stat)
  - Each boss can only be recruited once
  - Recruited bosses are "reformed" versions (evil → neutral/good)

  Why: Creates memorable "wow" moments, ties to combat.

  ---
  3. Achievement Unlocks (Milestone Rewards)

  Concept: Specific achievements grant specific companions.

  🏆 ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!
  "Night Owl" - Complete 50 quests after 10pm

  You've unlocked: "The Nocturne" (Rogue variant)

  A mysterious figure emerges from the shadows...
  "You work late. So do I. Let's work together."

  [Add to Stable]

  Examples:
  - "Early Bird" → "The Dawn Herald" (Cleric)
  - "Social Butterfly" → "The Networker" (Bard)
  - "Code Warrior" → "The Debugger" (Technomancer)
  - "Gym Rat" → "Coach Marcus" (Warrior/Paladin)

  Why: Rewards diverse playstyles, adds value to achievements.

  ---
  4. Dungeon Rescues (Exploration Reward)

  Concept: Find imprisoned companions in specific dungeon rooms.

  DUNGEON ROOM: Prison Cell
  ════════════════════════════

  You hear a voice from behind iron bars...

  "Help me! I've been trapped here for months!"

  [Free the Prisoner] - Fight 2 Elite Guards
  [Leave]

  Implementation:
  - 5% chance per dungeon floor to spawn "prison room"
  - Must defeat guards (harder than normal encounter)
  - Rescued companion joins stable immediately
  - Each dungeon type has unique prisoner pool

  Why: Makes dungeons more rewarding, adds exploration incentive.

  ---
  5. Recurring Quest Loyalty (Habit Reward)

  Concept: Complete the same recurring quest 20 times → unlock dedicated assistant.

  RECURRING QUEST MILESTONE!
  ════════════════════════════
  "Morning Workout" completed 20 times!

  Your dedication has attracted a training partner...

  "Coach Sarah" wants to join your party!
  Class: Warrior/Cleric hybrid
  Bonus: Recovers 5 stamina when Fitness quests complete

  [Recruit]

  Why: Rewards consistency, ties to habit-building (core ADHD benefit).

  ---
  🪙 TOKEN ECONOMY SYSTEM

  Problem: Pure RNG feels bad. What if you want a specific companion?

  Solution: Recruitment Tokens.

  How to Earn Tokens:

  - Bounty Completion: 1 token per bounty
  - Weekly Streak: 2 tokens for 7-day quest streak
  - Achievement Milestones: 5 tokens for major achievements
  - Dungeon Completion: 3 tokens for full dungeon clear

  How to Spend Tokens:

  GUILD HALL - RECRUITMENT BOARD
  ══════════════════════════════
  Your Tokens: 12 🪙

  AVAILABLE COMPANIONS:
  ┌─────────────────────────────┐
  │ "The Wanderer" (Rogue)      │
  │ Cost: 5 🪙                  │
  │ Stats: 75% of player        │

  │ Trait: +15% XP from quests  │

  └─────────────────────────────┘

  Why: Player agency, prevents frustration, strategic choice.

  ⚖️ BALANCING CONSTRAINTS

  Party Limits:

  - Active Party: 3 companions max (4 total including player)
  - Stable: 15 companions max
  - Recruitment Cooldown: 1 per week (bypassed with tokens)

  Companion Stats:

  - Base: 70% of player's equivalent class stats
  - Scaling: Companions level with player (always -2 levels)
  - Gear: Companions use their own starter gear (not player gear)

  Loyalty System:

  LOYALTY METER
  ══════════════
  Each companion has loyalty (0-100%)

  Loyalty Increases:
  - Complete quests in their preferred category (+5%)
  - Win battles with them in party (+2%)
  - Rest at inn (full restore)

  Loyalty Decreases:
  - Lose battles (-10%)
  - Don't use them for 7 days (-5%)
  - Dismiss from party mid-quest (-15%)

  Low Loyalty Effects:
  - <50%: Stats reduced to 60% of player
  - <25%: May refuse to fight
  - 0%: Leaves your stable permanently

  Why: Prevents "set and forget," encourages party rotation.

  Preferred Category Bonus:

  "The Athlete" (Warrior)

  🎮 MONSTER PARTIES (Enemy Balance)

  If player has companions, enemies scale:
  ┌────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Difficulty │ Player Party │               Enemy Party               │
  ├────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Overworld  │ 1-4 members  │ 1 enemy (solo)                          │
  ├────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Dungeon    │ 1-4 members  │ 1 + (1-2 minions)                       │
  ├────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Boss       │ 1-4 members  │ 1 boss + (2-3 elite guards)             │
  ├────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Raid Boss  │ 1-4 members  │ 1 raid boss + (3-4 legendary champions) │
  └────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  Scaling Rule: Total enemy power = Player party power × 0.9 (slight player advantage).

  What do you think? Does the Vault Scanner scratch that Digimon itch? I love the idea of scanning your vault and
  discovering "The Ancient One" because you've been taking notes for 5 years. Very cool discovery moment!
