## Session 0: Pre-Implementation Cleanup — 2026-02-07

**Focus:** Remove dead code (badge system, spriteFolder setting), normalize tile filenames, delete deprecated components

### Completed
- [x] Badge system removal — removed `badgeFolder`/`badgePath` from 14 files (`Achievement.ts`, `settings.ts`, `AchievementService.ts`, `AchievementUnlockModal.ts`, `AchievementHubModal.ts`, `AchievementsSidebar.tsx`, `useXPAward.ts`, `SidebarQuests.tsx`, `FullKanban.tsx`, `CharacterPage.tsx`, `main.ts`, `QuestActionsService.ts`)
- [x] `spriteFolder` setting removal — removed from 3 files (`settings.ts`, `CharacterSidebar.tsx`, `SidebarQuests.tsx`)
- [x] Tile filename normalization — renamed 72 environment tile files (66 with spaces + 6 camelCase → kebab-case)
- [x] Updated `TileRegistry.ts` — 8 sprite path references updated (`cave gravel.png` → `cave-gravel.png`, `granite floor.png` → `granite-floor.png`)
- [x] Deleted deprecated `CharacterSheet.tsx` + removed comment reference in `gearFormatters.ts`
- [x] Confirmed `DungeonView.tsx` and `CharacterCreationModal.ts` were already clean (no changes needed)

### Files Changed
| Action | Files |
|--------|-------|
| **Modified** | `Achievement.ts`, `settings.ts`, `AchievementService.ts`, `AchievementUnlockModal.ts`, `AchievementHubModal.ts`, `AchievementsSidebar.tsx`, `useXPAward.ts`, `SidebarQuests.tsx`, `FullKanban.tsx`, `CharacterPage.tsx`, `CharacterSidebar.tsx`, `main.ts`, `QuestActionsService.ts`, `gearFormatters.ts`, `TileRegistry.ts` |
| **Deleted** | `CharacterSheet.tsx` |
| **Renamed** | 72 environment tile files in `assets/environment/` |

### Testing Notes
- Build: ✅ Clean compile (0 errors)
- Tests: 333 pass / 34 fail (all pre-existing — power-up rebalance tests, gear-migration, flaky combat sim)
- Deployed to test vault: ✅
- Smoke test (5 items): ✅ All passed

### Blockers/Issues
- None

### Next Steps
- Session 1: Phase 1 (AssetService foundation) + Phase 2 (Download modal)

---

## Session 1: Phase 1 — AssetService Foundation — 2026-02-07

**Focus:** Create the core `AssetService` class that handles remote asset fetching, caching, and versioning

### Completed
- [x] Created `AssetService.ts` — full service implementing `isFirstRun()`, `checkForUpdates()`, `downloadAssets()`, `cleanupOrphanedFiles()`, `getStoragePath()`, `getDisplayPath()`
- [x] Concurrency-limited download queue (max 5 parallel)
- [x] Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts per file)
- [x] Path traversal protection (reject `..` and leading `/`)
- [x] Content-Type validation (image/* or octet-stream only)
- [x] File extension allowlist (`.png`, `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`)
- [x] Manifest size guard (reject > 1MB)
- [x] Empty response body guard
- [x] Safe JSON parsing via `safeJsonParse` for manifests
- [x] Manifest written last for atomic installation (TOCTOU prevention)
- [x] Exported `AssetManifest` interface for Phase 2 consumers
- [x] Extended Obsidian mock (`requestUrl`, `DataAdapter`, Vault adapter methods)
- [x] Created 19 unit tests covering all public methods + security validations

### Files Changed
| Action | Files |
|--------|-------|
| **Created** | `src/services/AssetService.ts`, `test/asset-service.test.ts` |
| **Modified** | `test/mocks/obsidian.ts` |

### Testing Notes
- Build: ✅ Clean compile (0 errors, 4.17 MB)
- New tests: ✅ All 19 pass
- Full suite: 33 pre-existing failures (gear-migration, combat balance) — no new regressions
- No manual testing needed — service is standalone with no UI integration yet

### Blockers/Issues
- Obsidian's `RequestUrlParam` type doesn't include `timeout` despite supporting it at runtime — used `RequestUrlParamWithTimeout` interface extension with type assertion

### Next Steps
- Phase 3: Consumer migration (update `SpriteService`, `DungeonView`, etc. to use `AssetService`)
- Phase 4: Wire `AssetService` into `main.ts` startup + add settings UI

---

## Session 1 (continued): Phase 2 — AssetDownloadModal — 2026-02-07

**Focus:** Create the download progress modal with priority queue, cancel support, and polished UI

### Completed
- [x] Created `AssetDownloadModal.ts` — full modal with progress bar, cancel support, success/error states
- [x] Exported `prioritizeFiles()` function — sorts files so current character class sprites download first
- [x] Priority tiers: (1) class sprites → (2) other sprites → (3) tiles/backgrounds
- [x] Cancel safety: already-downloaded files left intact, manifest not written, next startup resumes
- [x] Orphan cleanup: runs `cleanupOrphanedFiles()` after successful download
- [x] CSS styles added to `modals.css` — progress bar, stats, completion/error states
- [x] 9 unit tests for `prioritizeFiles()` — class priority, ordering, edge cases, immutability
- [x] Added "Deferred Features" section to implementation guide (lazy loading, startup optimization)

### Files Changed
| Action | Files |
|--------|-------|
| **Created** | `src/modals/AssetDownloadModal.ts`, `test/asset-download-modal.test.ts` |
| **Modified** | `src/styles/modals.css`, implementation guide |

### Testing Notes
- Build: ✅ Clean compile (0 errors, 4.17 MB)
- New tests: ✅ All 9 pass
- Existing asset tests: ✅ All 19 pass (no regressions)
- Deployed to test vault: ✅
- No manual testing needed yet — modal is not wired into main.ts (Phase 4)

### Blockers/Issues
- None

### Next Steps
- Phase 3: SpriteService & component migration (`manifestDir` → `assetFolder`)
- Phase 4: Wire into `main.ts` (first-run check, "Check for Updates" command, settings UI)

---

## Session 2: Phase 3 — SpriteService & Component Migration — 2026-02-07

**Focus:** Rename all `manifestDir` parameters/props/variables to `assetFolder` across codebase; consolidate inline sprite path helpers to use `SpriteService`; replace hardcoded vault paths

### Completed
- [x] **Core Services (Layer 1):** Updated `SpriteService.ts` (10 functions) and `TileRegistry.ts` (2 functions) — `manifestDir` → `assetFolder`
- [x] **Hooks (Layer 2):** Updated `useCharacterSprite.ts` and `useQuestActions.ts` interfaces and implementations
- [x] **Services (Layer 3):** Updated `QuestActionsService.ts` — `MoveQuestOptions` and `CompleteQuestOptions`
- [x] **Modals (Layer 4):** Updated `BountyModal.ts`, `EliteEncounterModal.ts`, and `CharacterCreationModal.ts`
  - `CharacterCreationModal.ts`: Replaced hardcoded vault path (`Life/Quest Board/assets/class-previews/{classId}.gif`) with `SpriteService.getClassPreviewSprite()`, removed unused `TFile` import
- [x] **Components & Views (Layer 5):** Updated `DungeonView.tsx` (22 edits), `DungeonItemView.tsx`, `BattleItemView.tsx`, `SidebarQuests.tsx` (3 locations), `FullKanban.tsx` (2 locations), `CharacterPage.tsx`
  - `DungeonView.tsx`: Consolidated inline `getPlayerSpritePath` helper to use `SpriteService.getPlayerSpritePath()`, fixing underscore vs hyphen inconsistency; replaced inline combat overlay path construction with `getMonsterGifPath()` and `getPlayerBattleSprite()` calls
- [x] **Entry Point:** Updated `main.ts` — elite encounter modal call

### Files Changed
| Action | Files |
|--------|-------|
| **Modified** | `SpriteService.ts`, `TileRegistry.ts`, `useCharacterSprite.ts`, `useQuestActions.ts`, `QuestActionsService.ts`, `BountyModal.ts`, `EliteEncounterModal.ts`, `CharacterCreationModal.ts`, `DungeonView.tsx`, `DungeonItemView.tsx`, `BattleItemView.tsx`, `SidebarQuests.tsx`, `FullKanban.tsx`, `CharacterPage.tsx`, `main.ts` |

### Testing Notes
- Build: ✅ Clean compile (0 errors, 4.17 MB)
- Tests: 362 pass / 33 fail (all pre-existing — gear-migration, power-up-triggers)
- Final grep: ✅ Zero `manifestDir` references in `src/` or `main.ts`
- Deployed to test vault: ✅

### Key Design Decisions
- **Filename convention consolidation:** `DungeonView.tsx` inline helper used underscores (`warrior_tier_1_south.png`) while `SpriteService` uses hyphens (`warrior-tier-1_south.png`). Removed inline helper in favor of SpriteService, making hyphens the single source of truth
- **`CharacterCreationModal` hardcoded path:** Was using `Life/Quest Board/assets/class-previews/{classId}.gif` (vault-relative). Replaced with `getClassPreviewSprite()` which uses tier-4 showcase GIF from the standard sprite asset structure

### Blockers/Issues
- None

### Next Steps
- Phase 4: Wire `AssetService` into `main.ts` startup (first-run check, "Check for Updates" command, connect `assetFolder` to `AssetService.getStoragePath()`)

---

## Session 3: Phase 4 — Main Plugin Integration — 2026-02-07

**Focus:** Wire `AssetService` into plugin lifecycle, add settings UI, register command, replace all remaining `manifest.dir` references

### Completed
- [x] **Settings fields:** Added `assetFolder` (default: `QuestBoard/assets`), `assetUpdateFrequency` (`daily`/`weekly`/`manual`, default: `weekly`), `lastAssetCheck` (timestamp) to `QuestBoardSettings` interface and `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`
- [x] **Settings UI:** Added "Asset Delivery" subsection inside File Paths (Section 2) with folder autocomplete text input, update frequency dropdown, "Check Now" button, last-check timestamp display, and path-change handler with auto-redownload
- [x] **AssetService initialization:** `this.assetService` created in `onload()` after `loadSettings()`
- [x] **First-run check:** `checkAssetsOnStartup()` detects first run (no manifest), shows `AssetDownloadModal` with `isFirstRun: true`
- [x] **Periodic update check:** Background check respects `assetUpdateFrequency` setting, skips if not due, notifies user if updates available
- [x] **Command:** "Check for Asset Updates" (`check-asset-updates`) registered in command palette
- [x] **`deleteAllAssets()` method:** Added to `AssetService` for path-change cleanup (reads manifest, removes all files + manifest)
- [x] **2MB file size guard:** Added to `downloadFileWithRetry()` — rejects files exceeding 2MB
- [x] **`manifest.dir` → `settings.assetFolder`:** Replaced ALL remaining references (9 files total):
  - `main.ts` (elite encounter), `DungeonItemView.tsx`, `BattleItemView.tsx`, `CharacterCreationModal.ts`
  - `SidebarQuests.tsx` (3 locations), `FullKanban.tsx` (2 locations), `CharacterPage.tsx`
- [x] **Battle-bg path fix:** Removed duplicate `/assets/` from `BattleItemView.tsx` background path

### Files Changed
| Action | Files |
|--------|-------|
| **Modified** | `settings.ts`, `main.ts`, `AssetService.ts`, `DungeonItemView.tsx`, `BattleItemView.tsx`, `CharacterCreationModal.ts`, `SidebarQuests.tsx`, `FullKanban.tsx`, `CharacterPage.tsx` |

### Testing Notes
- Build: ✅ Clean compile (0 errors, 4.17 MB)
- Asset tests: ✅ All 28 pass (19 AssetService + 9 AssetDownloadModal)
- Full suite: Pre-existing failures only (power-up-triggers) — no new regressions
- Final grep: ✅ Zero `manifest.dir` references in `src/` or `main.ts`
- Deployed to test vault: ✅

### Manual Testing Checklist (for Brad)
- [x] Open Settings → File Paths → verify "Asset Delivery" section appears with Asset Folder, Update Frequency dropdown, and "Check Now" button
- [x] Open command palette → search "Check for Asset Updates" → verify command exists
- [x] Open Character page → verify character sprite renders
- [x] Enter a dungeon → verify tiles render correctly
- [x] Start a battle → verify player sprite, monster sprite, and background render

### Blockers/Issues
- First-run download and CDN update checks cannot be fully tested until assets are published to the GitHub CDN (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thuban87/quest-board@main/assets`)
- Pre-existing test failure in `power-up-triggers.test.ts` — unrelated to asset delivery

### Next Steps
- Phase 5: CDN publishing (upload assets + manifest.json to GitHub repo)
- Wire `AssetService.getDisplayPath()` into `SpriteService`/`TileRegistry` to replace `adapter.getResourcePath()` with vault-relative paths
- Existing user migration: detect old `assets/` folder inside plugin dir, prompt to re-download

---

## Session 4: Phase 4 Bug Fixes & First-Install UX — 2026-02-07

**Focus:** Fix critical bugs from Phase 4 integration (broken sprites, settings UX, manifest persistence, CDN caching), improve first-install experience

### Completed—Bug Fixes
- [x] **Double `/assets/` path bug:** `SpriteService.getBasePath()`, `TileRegistry.ts` (2 paths), and `DungeonView.tsx` (2 paths) were prepending `/assets/` to `assetFolder`, but `assetFolder` already IS the assets directory — created double paths like `QuestBoard/assets/assets/sprites/...`. Removed the `/assets/` prefix from all 5 locations
- [x] **Settings keystroke-triggered download:** `onChange` handler fired on every character typed in the Asset Folder field, deleting and re-downloading assets per keystroke. Replaced with `blur`-based handler (only fires when user clicks away)
- [x] **Manifest persistence:** `downloadAssets()` threw on ANY file failure and skipped writing `manifest.json`, causing "assets not found" notice on every reload. Moved manifest write BEFORE the error throw — partial downloads now produce a valid manifest, failed files retry on next update check
- [x] **HTTP cache-busting:** Added `?t=${Date.now()}` to `fetchRemoteManifest()` and `downloadFileWithRetry()` URLs. Electron's local HTTP cache was serving stale responses even after jsDelivr CDN cache was purged

### Completed—First-Install UX
- [x] **`AssetConfigModal`:** New modal shown on true first install — folder path input with autocomplete, recommendation text, Download/Skip buttons
- [x] **`assetConfigured` flag:** Added boolean to settings (default: `false`). Distinguishes "never installed" from "assets missing after config"
- [x] **Existing user migration:** If `lastAssetCheck > 0`, auto-sets `assetConfigured = true` on load (prevents first-install modal for existing users)
- [x] **Rewritten `checkAssetsOnStartup()`:** Three-case logic:
  1. `!assetConfigured` → show `AssetConfigModal` (first install)
  2. `assetConfigured` + no manifest → silent Notice ("assets not found")
  3. `assetConfigured` + manifest → normal periodic update check

### Files Changed
| Action | Files |
|--------|-------|
| **Created** | `src/modals/AssetConfigModal.ts` |
| **Modified** | `AssetService.ts` (manifest write order, cache-busting), `settings.ts` (`assetConfigured` flag, blur handler), `main.ts` (import, migration, rewritten startup), `SpriteService.ts`, `TileRegistry.ts`, `DungeonView.tsx` (removed double `/assets/`) |

### Testing Notes
- Build: ✅ Clean compile (0 errors, 4.17 MB)
- Deployed to test vault: ✅
- Manual testing results:
  - Character page sprites: ✅
  - Dungeon tiles (including renamed kebab-case files): ✅
  - Battle sprites + background: ✅
  - Settings Asset Folder field (no keystroke triggers): ✅
  - First-install AssetConfigModal: ✅
  - Manifest persists across reloads: ✅
  - CDN download with correct filenames after cache-bust: ✅

### Blockers/Issues
- jsDelivr directory purge (`/assets/`) does NOT recursively purge individual files — must purge `manifest.json` specifically
- Electron HTTP cache required cache-busting params; CDN purge alone is not sufficient

### Next Steps
- ~~Wire `AssetService.getDisplayPath()` into `SpriteService`/`TileRegistry` to replace `adapter.getResourcePath()`~~ Deferred (current path resolution works correctly)
- ~~Existing user migration: detect old `assets/` inside plugin dir, prompt to re-download to vault folder~~ Deemed unnecessary

## Session 5: Phase 5 — Deploy Script & Bug Fixes — 2026-02-07

**Focus:** Fix AssetConfigModal autocomplete bug, update deploy script for asset delivery, final production + mobile verification

### Completed
- [x] **`AssetConfigModal` autocomplete bug fix:** `FolderSuggest` sets `inputEl.value` directly and triggers a raw DOM `input` event, but the modal's `onChange` handler (via Obsidian `TextComponent`) was not fired by this event. Added `getCurrentPath()` method that reads the DOM input element's value at save time, bypassing the unreliable callback. Both `handleDownload()` and "Skip" button now use this.
- [x] **Settings.ts verified safe:** The settings panel's asset folder handler uses `text.getValue()` on `blur`, which correctly reads the current DOM value — no fix needed there.
- [x] **Deploy script update (`deploy.mjs`):** Added `ASSET_FOLDERS` mapping for test/staging vault paths. Assets now copy to the vault's asset folder (e.g., `Life/Quest Board/assets`) instead of the plugin directory. Production skips asset copying entirely (CDN delivery). Console output updated with clear sections for plugin files and assets.
- [x] **Production deploy:** All plugin files deployed, first-run modal worked, assets downloaded from CDN, all sprites/tiles/backgrounds rendering correctly.
- [x] **Mobile sync verification:** Obsidian Sync transferred assets to mobile device. Second device detected assets already in place (no re-download). Character sidebar, character page, dungeons, and battles all working on mobile.

### Files Changed
| Action | Files |
|--------|-------|
| **Modified** | `src/modals/AssetConfigModal.ts` (getCurrentPath method, DOM input reference), `deploy.mjs` (ASSET_FOLDERS mapping, conditional asset copying) |

### Testing Notes
- Build: ✅ Clean compile (0 errors, 4.17 MB)
- Deploy to test: ✅ (560 asset files to vault folder)
- Deploy to staging: ✅ (560 asset files to vault folder)
- Deploy to production: ✅ (plugin files only, assets via CDN)
- First-run modal: ✅ Autocomplete path saved correctly
- Asset rendering (desktop): ✅ Character sidebar, character page, dungeons, battles
- Asset rendering (mobile): ✅ Character sidebar, character page, dungeons, battles
- Multi-device sync: ✅ Assets synced, no re-download on second device

### Blockers/Issues
- None

### 🎉 Feature Complete
All 5 phases of Remote Asset Delivery implemented and verified across desktop (test, staging, production) and mobile. CDN delivery working end-to-end.
