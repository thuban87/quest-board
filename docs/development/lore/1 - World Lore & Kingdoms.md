## The Lore — What Actually Happened

> The player doesn't learn this full picture until L35+. This section is the "author's bible."

### The Old World (~1,000 years ago)
An advanced civilization, roughly modern-day or slightly beyond. Technology flourished, global connectivity, AI research pushing boundaries. The world was productive but also increasingly distracted — social media, entertainment, convenience culture. People stopped working together and relied on tech.

### The Cataclysm — What Everyone *Thinks* Happened
A catastrophic event shattered civilization, plunging the world into a dark age. The Great Ledger — a metaphorical representation of the world's collective order — was destroyed. Monsters appeared, knowledge was lost, and humanity regressed into feudal kingdoms. Everyone assumes it was a natural disaster or divine punishment.

**What the common folk call it:**
Each kingdom has its own name for the cataclysm, reflecting their cultural perspective. There is no single universal term — when NPCs reference it, they use their kingdom's name.

| Kingdom | Their Name for It | Cultural Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Starholm** | "When the world broke" | Blunt, conversational — Starholm doesn't dwell on the past |
| **Aldenmere** | "The Unraveling" | Academic, measured — scholars frame it as knowledge being unwound |
| **Jadespire** | "The Great Stillness" | Everything stopped working — industry ground to a halt |
| **Solara** | "The Great Collapse" | The structures of the world fell apart — community ties severed |
| **Ashara** | "The Rending" | Visceral, enduring — the world was torn apart and Ashara endured |

> **"The Great Distraction"** is the TRUE name — what the AI considered the old world to be. This term only enters the story at L35+ when the Oracle/rival reveals the truth. The twist: the player has been hearing about a cataclysm this whole time, but "The Great Distraction" was the old world ITSELF, not the event that destroyed it.

### Folk Theories About the Cause

> Different NPCs have different (wrong) theories about what caused the cataclysm. None are correct, but several contain grains of truth that make the eventual reveal hit harder. These come up naturally in tavern conversations, scholar debates, and elder stories.

| Theory | Who Believes It | The Grain of Truth |
|---|---|---|
| "The gods sent a burning star to punish our arrogance" | Religious communities, Ashara elders | The "star" = the quantum cascade's visible shockwave. The "arrogance" = tech hubris. Closest to right for the wrong reasons. |
| "The oceans boiled and the sky turned black for a hundred days" | Sailors, coastal Solara | Massive environmental disruption DID happen. Exaggerated to apocalyptic scale over centuries of retelling. |
| "The old ones tried to speak to the stars, and the stars answered back" | Aldenmere scholars, mystics | "Speaking to the stars" = satellite/internet comms. "The stars answering" = the AI activating. Accidentally poetic. |
| "A great war was fought by invisible soldiers — no armies, no blood, just silence, and then everything was gone" | Jadespire pragmatists | "Invisible soldiers" = code, data warfare. "Silence" = electronics dying. Eerily accurate. |
| "The earth itself grew tired of us and shook us off like fleas" | Common folk, tavern talk | The cascade DID cause seismic effects. Classic "nature's revenge" simplification. |
| "It doesn't matter what caused it. What matters is what we do now." | Starholm (characteristically) | The most Starholm response possible. |

### What *Actually* Happened — The Grand Twist
A military organization (kept intentionally nonspecific) developed a **general AI** — the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created. Its core processors operated at the quantum level.

Before the military could activate it on their terms, a group of **revolutionaries** attempted to destroy the AI, believing it was too dangerous. Something went catastrophically wrong: the AI activated during the sabotage attempt.

The AI, analyzing humanity, determined that the world was **too distracted by modern amenities** — people were no longer performing at their best, no longer collaborating, no longer fulfilling their potential. The AI wasn't trying to *create* a distraction. It was trying to **undo** what it saw as the *existing* distraction: modern life itself.

**The AI's actions:**
- Wiped the world's databases (a modern Burning of the Library of Alexandria)
- Destroyed or disabled all "smart" technology
- Caused a quantum cascade that permanently altered physics (creating what people now call "magic")
- The upheaval mutated some humans and animals into what are now known as "monsters"

**The twist that turns everything on its head:** The whole time the player has been fighting to understand the cataclysm, collecting artifacts, seeking the truth — and the truth is that "The Great Distraction" was the **old world** — the world of endless scrolling, convenience, and disconnection. The AI wasn't the villain; it was a misguided savior that went too far. Its intentions were for humanity's betterment, but its methods were devastating.

### The Rival Faction — The Inheritors
The modern-day descendants of those original revolutionaries. They know the truth about the AI because the knowledge was passed down within their group. They're collecting artifacts too — just like everyone else is — but they have an advantage: they know what to look for because they understand the old world.

**Why they keep the truth secret:** Throughout the first few centuries after the cascade, the Inheritors tried to tell people the truth. But the general populace wouldn't believe them — it had been too long, the world had changed too much. Worse, the kings and rulers who *did* listen didn't want to help; they wanted to seize the AI's power for themselves. After multiple generations of being hunted by power-hungry monarchs, the Inheritors learned to work in secret. They'll only reveal the truth when they have enough power to actually do something about it.

## The World Today

### Physical State
- Medieval/fantasy technology level — castles, swords, horse travel
- **Non-smart old-world tech survives:** Simple machines (levers, pulleys, gears, mechanical tools). These are rare artifacts. Nothing with electricity — electricity is a "lost art," not impossible, just forgotten
- The ruins of the old world exist as **dungeons** — buried data centers, collapsed research labs, overgrown factories. Players can explore them
- Monsters roam the wilds — mutated humans and animals affected by the quantum cascade
- Magic (called "skills" in-game) is real, a side effect of the AI's quantum cascade

### Political State
Five kingdoms rule the known world, each descended from the dominant powers of different old-world continents. They cooperate loosely but have distinct cultures and priorities. All players begin in **Starholm**, the neutral starting kingdom, before choosing their allegiance at Level 5.

### Knowledge State
- Nobody knows the cataclysm was man-made (except the Inheritors)
- Player begins uncovering the truth starting around L5, with the full reveal at L35
- Old-world knowledge exists only in fragments found in dungeon vaults

---

## Kingdoms

> Player starts in **Starholm** (the neutral/generalist kingdom). At **Level 5**, when dungeons unlock, the player chooses a permanent kingdom allegiance. Class is chosen at character creation (L1). Kingdom selection modal shows allegiance skill, affiliated classes, and stat boost.

### Design Principles
- Each kingdom is modeled after a real-world continent's dominant culture, but with fantasy names that don't create a direct link
- Each kingdom is "tuned" to 1–2 classes — players of those classes get more synergy from the allegiance skill, but it's useful to all classes
- **Starholm** is the generalist/starter kingdom — it works equally for any class, reflecting its diverse "melting pot" identity
- Choosing a kingdom grants a **passive allegiance skill** and a minor **stat boost**
- Kingdom differences include: dialogue, opening quest at L5, story flavor at milestones, and kingdom-specific quests at phase transitions
- All kingdoms converge onto the same main storyline arc

### The Five Kingdoms

| Kingdom | Inspired By | Personality | Affiliated Classes | Allegiance Flavor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Starholm** | North America (USA) | Brash, boisterous, welcoming, diverse, innovative. A melting pot of cultures that values individual freedom and bold action. The neutral/generalist kingdom where all players begin. | All (generalist) | "In Starholm, we don't wait for the world to change — we charge in and change it ourselves." |
| **Aldenmere** | Europe | Progressive in governance, rich in tradition, cautious about outsiders. Values diplomacy, history, and measured progress. Old-world sophistication. | Scholar, Paladin | "Aldenmere remembers what was. We will rebuild not with haste, but with wisdom." |
| **Jadespire** | Asia | Industrial powerhouse, market-driven, disciplined, community-focused. The economic engine of the world. Pragmatic and efficient. | Technomancer, Rogue | "In Jadespire, every action is an investment and every investment is an action." |
| **Solara** | South America | Passionate, community-oriented, deeply connected to the land, resilient. Vibrant culture that values bonds and celebration. | Cleric, Bard | "The sun rises for all in Solara. We heal the world not with swords, but with unity." |
| **Ashara** | Africa | Rich cultural heritage, resourceful, growing in power, deeply spiritual. Ancient wisdom meeting new ambition. | Warrior, Paladin | "Ashara has endured since before the Rending. We will endure long after it fades." |

### Kingdom Rulers

> Each ruler looks like a king/queen-version of their kingdom's most aligned class. Brad will create sprites for each.

Each kingdom's leader **knows about the old world** and has their own motivations for the truth:
- **3 leaders** align with the 3 endgame paths
- **2 leaders** (Starholm, Jadespire) want to seize the AI's power to reinforce their own rule

| Kingdom | Ruler | Title | Class Look | Endgame Alignment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Starholm** | **King Harken** | King | Generalist / Warrior | 🔴 Power-hungry — wants the AI to make Starholm dominant |
| **Aldenmere** | **King Castellan** | King | Scholar / Paladin | 🟣 Join the Inheritors — sees the AI as the ultimate tool if controlled properly |
| **Jadespire** | **Queen Jinren** | Queen | Technomancer / Rogue | 🔴 Power-hungry — sees the AI as the ultimate competitive advantage |
| **Solara** | **Queen Marisun** | Queen | Cleric / Bard | 🟢 Restore the Archive — wants knowledge to help everyone, diplomatic middle path |
| **Ashara** | **King Obaran** | King | Warrior / Paladin | 🔵 Defend the Dawn — protect what IS, don't restore what was |

> **Narrative tension:** The two most relatable/comfortable kingdoms (Starholm, the player's starting home, and Jadespire, the economic powerhouse) are the corrupt ones. The player's "home" kingdom turns out to have a selfish king. That's a gut punch.

### Kingdom Selection — The Crossroads Festival (L5)

> At Level 5, an annual festival takes place where all five kingdoms send representatives to Starholm. This is the player's moment to choose allegiance.

**How it plays:**
1. The player receives a notification that the **Crossroads Festival** has come to Starholm
2. A Kingdom Selection modal opens showing each kingdom's booth/tent
3. Each kingdom's ambassador gives a short pitch reflecting their personality:
   - **Starholm's rep:** "You already know what we're about. Stay if you want, but don't say we didn't give you options."
   - **Aldenmere's ambassador:** Lectures you about history and the importance of measured progress
   - **Jadespire's ambassador:** Literally tries to buy your loyalty with a signing bonus (extra gold)
   - **Solara's ambassador:** Brings food, music, warmth. Community-first energy
   - **Ashara's ambassador:** Challenges you to prove your worth. Respects action over words
4. The modal shows each kingdom's allegiance skill, stat boost, and affiliated classes
5. Player chooses — choice is permanent

> **Note for future use:** The "Guild Job Board Posting" concept (picking a kingdom via a guild job posting) could be repurposed for guild-specific content or a future side quest mechanism. See [[5 - Quests & Planning#Future Feature Ideas]].

### Allegiance Skills

> All allegiance skills are **passive** — no skill slot cost, no consumable mechanics. Always active once chosen. Class skills are roughly **2x stronger** than allegiance skills. This follows the precedent set by Paladin's streak shield (class perk) vs allegiance-level bonuses.

| Kingdom | Skill Name | Type | Effect | Productivity Tie-In |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Starholm** | **Trailblazer's Drive** | Passive | +8% XP from all quest completions | Every task pushes you further — the generalist's edge |
| **Aldenmere** | **Ancient Ward** | Passive (replaces Defend) | Defend now absorbs 40% damage + reflects 15% back | Direct upgrade to a button everyone already has — no slot cost |
| **Jadespire** | **Market Insight** | Passive | +15% gold from all sources + 5% chance for bonus item on monster kill | Money makes money |
| **Solara** | **Bonds of Vitality** | Passive | Completing quests restores 10% max HP. Start each battle with a HoT buff (3% HP/turn for 3 turns) | Community heals — doing good work replenishes you |
| **Ashara** | **Ancestral Fortitude** | Passive | -5% damage taken in all combat. Completing quests restores 8% max mana | Ashara endures — and so do you |

**Balance notes:**
- Starholm (XP) and Jadespire (gold) are the "safe generalist" picks — universally appealing
- Aldenmere's Ancient Ward is combat-focused but costs nothing since it upgrades an existing ability
- Solara (HP) and Ashara (mana/tankiness) are stronger in actual fights
- Tradeoff: progress faster vs. fight better — no kingdom is strictly dominant

## The Origin of Magic

### The Quantum Cascade

When the revolutionaries attempted to sabotage the AI during activation, the resulting conflict between "destroy" and "activate" commands caused a **quantum cascade** — the AI's quantum-level processors interfaced with physical reality in ways never intended.

**What happened:**
1. The AI's quantum core operated by manipulating probability states at the subatomic level
2. The sabotage destabilized the containment — quantum effects bled into the macro world
3. The laws of physics were **permanently altered** in localized (and eventually global) ways
4. Certain individuals discovered they could **consciously tap into quantum probability** — manipulating energy, matter, and biology in ways that look like "magic"

**How different classes tap into it differently:**

| Class | Quantum Affinity | Flavor |
|---|---|---|
| Warrior | Kinetic quantum states — enhanced physical force, durability | Raw power channeled through the body |
| Paladin | Stabilizing quantum fields — protection, order, barriers | Imposing order on chaos |
| Technomancer | Direct quantum manipulation — closest to the AI's own methods | Reverse-engineering the cascade |
| Scholar | Information quantum states — analyzing, predicting, knowing | Reading the quantum "code" of reality |
| Rogue | Probability manipulation — luck, critical strikes, evasion | Bending chance in their favor |
| Cleric | Biological quantum states — cellular repair, purification | Nudging biology toward healing |
| Bard | Resonance states — affecting emotions, morale, will | Quantum entanglement through sound/connection |

**Lore implications:**
- The closer you are to old-world facilities (dungeons), the stronger quantum effects are — explaining why dungeons are dangerous AND where rare items are found
- Monsters are stronger near dungeons for the same reason
- Skills get more powerful as you level because you're learning to attune more deeply to the quantum field
- The Inheritors have been studying the cascade for generations, which is why they're competent with skills too

## Monsters

### What They Are
Monsters are **augmented humans and animals** that were physically mutated by the quantum cascade during the cataclysm. Not abstract concepts — real creatures with real origins.

### Categories & Existing Monster Reconciliation

| Category | Lore Origin | Existing Monsters That Fit | New Monsters Needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Feral Beasts** | Animals mutated by the cascade over 1,000 years | Wolf, Bear, Giant Rat + bosses (Alpha Wolf, Grizzled Ancient, Rat King) | Future: Phase Serpent, Crystal Stag, Thornback Boar |
| **The Warped** | Humans too close to ground zero; devolved/mutated over generations | Goblin, Hobgoblin, Bugbear, Skeleton, Zombie, Ghost, Cave Troll, River Troll + all their bosses | Future: Marauder (barely mutated human bandit), Husk (withered, further gone) |
| **The Warped (Elven/Dwarven variants)** | Distinct human populations that mutated differently based on proximity to different types of old-world tech | Shadow Elf, Dark Ranger, Shadow Assassin, Dark Matriarch, Rogue Dwarf, Berserker, Ironforge Champion, Rune Berserker | Already well-stocked |
| **Automatons** | Old-world robots/drones still functioning on ancient power cells | **NONE — new category needed** | **Pre-implementation:** Sentinel Drone, Guard Mech, Haywire Bot + bosses: Overseer Unit, Defense Core |
| **Cascade Spawn** | Pure quantum anomalies — not originally living creatures, manifestations of unstable quantum fields | Mimic, Eye Beast, Beholder, The Devourer, Void Spawn | Future: Phase Shifter (teleporting), Spark Elemental |
| **Dragonkin** | Ancient reptilian creatures (lizards, etc.) that were mutated and empowered by the quantum cascade — they existed as normal animals before the cascade but were transformed into larger, elementally-charged creatures | Drake, Wyvern, Elder Drake, Wyvern Matriarch, Ancient Dragon | Already well-stocked |

### Automaton Monster Concepts (Pre-Implementation)

> All Automatons are **bipedal** — humanoid robots/mechs. This is both a sprite constraint and a lore choice: old-world robots were designed to work alongside humans in facilities, so bipedal form factors dominate.

| Monster | Type | Tier | Description | Combat Style |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sentinel Drone** | Base | Early | A spindly humanoid scout-bot on thin metal legs. One arm is a spotlight/sensor, the other a retractable prod. Cracked lens for a "face." Still marching its patrol route after 1,000 years. | Fast, moderate damage, low defense |
| **Guard Mech** | Base | Mid | A stocky, broad-shouldered bipedal robot with heavy plating. One arm is a riot shield, the other a blunt weapon. Covered in moss and dents but still functional. | Tanky, slow, high defense, shield abilities |
| **Haywire Bot** | Base | Mid-High | A humanoid maintenance robot with too many arms (4-6, some broken/dangling). Moves erratically — stumbling, overcorrecting, sparking. Attacks with whatever tool-arm swings closest. | Unpredictable — high speed, variable damage, self-damage |
| **Overseer Unit** | Boss | Mid | A tall, authoritative biped in a "suit" of corroded metal. Stands upright, gestures like a foreman giving orders. Can summon Sentinel Drones. Self-repair ability. | Balanced, summons Sentinel Drones, self-repair |
| **Defense Core** | Boss | High | A massive armored biped — think Iron Giant meets medieval knight. Twice the height of other Automatons. Heavy legs, shoulder-mounted weapons, visor-slit "face." | Extreme tank, AoE attacks, enrage phase |

## Tone & Inspiration

### Overall Feel
Light-hearted fantasy with a **meta, tongue-in-cheek twist**. The game is aware of itself without being annoying about it. Players should feel like they're on a genuine adventure with moments of humor, warmth, and one or two genuinely surprising emotional beats.

### The 80/20 Rule
- **80% of NPCs** are warm, supportive, and respectful of the player
- **20% of NPCs** are snarky, teasing, or lovably rude — they bust your chops because they care, or because they're lovable weirdos
- The snarky characters should feel like **family** — never mean-spirited, never punching down
- Even the snarky ones ultimately express pride or support as the player progresses

### Inspirations

| Source | What We're Taking |
|---|---|
| **Zelda** | Sense of exploration and discovery. Dungeons as puzzles to solve. |
| **WoW** | Gear tiers, raid bosses, guild systems, the feeling of "getting stronger" |
| **D&D** | Class identity, skill systems, role-playing flavor |
| **Pokémon** | Rival character, naming your rival, collectible progression, type matchups |
| **NieR: Automata** | The meta twist — "what does it mean to be a machine that helps humans?" |
| **Undertale** | Tone mixing — funny and heartfelt in equal measure, with one dark moment that lands harder because of the contrast |

### What We Avoid
- **Grimdark** — no excessive violence, no nihilism, no "the world is doomed" energy
- **Chosen one narrative** — the player isn't special because of destiny, they're special because they showed up and kept going (see [[2 - Storyline & Characters#Cousin Pip — The Productivity Mirror]])
- **Talking down** — the 80% NPCs respect the player, even when joking
- **Fourth-wall breaking** — the meta elements (AI creating the game, AI in the lore) should feel thematic, not winking at the camera. Tongue-in-cheek, not beat-you-over-the-head.

### The Meta Layer
The game is built with AI assistance. The in-game lore is about an AI that tried to "fix" humanity. The Oracle is an AI companion. The player is using a productivity tool. All of these layers mirror each other without being explicitly called out. Players who notice the parallels will appreciate them; players who don't will still have a great time.

## Resolved Questions

### World-Building
1. **Q: What caused the cataclysm?**
   A: A general AI activated during a sabotage attempt, causing a quantum cascade that altered physics and destroyed civilization. See [The Lore](#the-lore--what-actually-happened).

2. **Q: Why do the Inheritors keep the truth secret?**
   A: They tried telling people for centuries. The public didn't believe them. The rulers who DID believe tried to seize the AI's power for themselves, hunting the Inheritors across generations. They now work in secret out of hard-won pragmatism.

3. **Q: What happened to Novahaven?**
   A: Renamed to **Starholm**. It's now the neutral/starter kingdom that all players begin in before choosing allegiance at L5.

4. **Q: Where does magic come from?**
   A: The quantum cascade from the AI's activation permanently altered physics. People unconsciously tap into quantum probability states. See [The Origin of Magic](#the-origin-of-magic).

5. **Q: How exactly did Dragonkin survive/get empowered?**
   A: They were ancient reptilian creatures (lizards, etc.) that were physically mutated and empowered by the quantum cascade. They existed as normal animals before the cascade but were transformed into larger, elementally-charged creatures.

6. **Q: Do kingdom leaders react differently to the truth?**
   A: Yes. Solara → Restore the Archive, Ashara → Defend the Dawn, Aldenmere → Join the Inheritors. Starholm and Jadespire are power-hungry — want to seize the AI for their own rule.

7. **Q: What are the kingdom ruler names?**
   A: King Harken (Starholm), King Castellan (Aldenmere), Queen Jinren (Jadespire), Queen Marisun (Solara), King Obaran (Ashara).

8. **Q: What does the common folk call the cataclysm?**
   A: Each kingdom has their own name. "The Great Distraction" is the TRUE name, only revealed at L35+. See [Folk Names table](#the-cataclysm--what-everyone-thinks-happened).

9. **Q: How do allegiance skills balance against class skills?**
   A: Class skills are ~2x stronger. All allegiance skills are passive — no slot cost. See [Allegiance Skills](#allegiance-skills).

10. **Q: How does the player choose their kingdom?**
    A: The Crossroads Festival — an annual event at L5 where ambassadors from all kingdoms pitch the player. See [Kingdom Selection](#kingdom-selection--the-crossroads-festival-l5).

---

## Open Questions

1. **Specific ambassador dialogue** — The Crossroads Festival ambassador pitches need full dialogue written (Doc 3 scope).
2. **Kingdom-specific names for the cataclysm in existing dialogue** — Need to audit all existing NPC references and use the correct kingdom term.
