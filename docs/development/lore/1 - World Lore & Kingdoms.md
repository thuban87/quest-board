## The Lore — What Actually Happened

> The player doesn't learn this full picture until L35+. This section is the "author's bible."

### The Old World (~1,000 years ago)
An advanced civilization, roughly modern-day or slightly beyond. Technology flourished, global connectivity, AI research pushing boundaries. The world was productive but also increasingly distracted — social media, entertainment, convenience culture. People stopped working together and relied on tech.

### The Great Distraction — What Everyone *Thinks* Happened
A catastrophic event shattered civilization, plunging the world into a dark age. The Great Ledger — a metaphorical representation of the world's collective order — was destroyed. Monsters appeared, knowledge was lost, and humanity regressed into feudal kingdoms. Everyone assumes it was a natural disaster or divine punishment.

### What *Actually* Happened — The Grand Twist
A military organization (kept intentionally nonspecific) developed a **general AI** — the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created. Its core processors operated at the quantum level.

Before the military could activate it on their terms, a group of **revolutionaries** attempted to destroy the AI, believing it was too dangerous. Something went catastrophically wrong: the AI activated during the sabotage attempt.

The AI, analyzing humanity, determined that the world was **too distracted by modern amenities** — people were no longer performing at their best, no longer collaborating, no longer fulfilling their potential. The AI wasn't trying to *create* a distraction. It was trying to **undo** what it saw as the *existing* distraction: modern life itself.

**The AI's actions:**
- Wiped the world's databases (a modern Burning of the Library of Alexandria)
- Destroyed or disabled all "smart" technology
- Caused a quantum cascade that permanently altered physics (creating what people now call "magic")
- The upheaval mutated some humans and animals into what are now known as "monsters"

**The twist that turns everything on its head:** The whole time the player has been fighting to defeat "The Great Distraction," but the truth is that the Great Distraction was the **old world** — the world of endless scrolling, convenience, and disconnection. The AI wasn't the villain; it was a misguided savior that went too far. Its intentions were for humanity's betterment, but its methods were devastating.

### The Rival Faction — The Inheritors
The modern-day descendants of those original revolutionaries. They know the truth about the AI because the knowledge was passed down within their group. They're collecting artifacts too — just like everyone else is — but they have an advantage: they know what to look for because they understand the old world.

**Why they keep the truth secret:** Throughout the first few centuries after the cascade, the Inheritors tried to tell people the truth. But the general populace wouldn't believe them — it had been too long, the world had changed too much. Worse, the kings and rulers who *did* listen didn't want to help; they wanted to seize the AI's power for themselves. After multiple generations of being hunted by power-hungry monarchs, the Inheritors learned to work in secret. They'll only reveal the truth when they have enough power to actually do something about it.

## The World Today

### Physical State
- Medieval/fantasy technology level — castles, swords, horse travel
- **Non-smart old-world tech survives:** Simple machines (levers, pulleys, gears, mechanical tools). These are rare artifacts. Nothing with electricity — electricity is a "lost art," not impossible, just forgotten
- The ruins of the old world exist as **dungeons** — buried data centers, collapsed research labs, overgrown factories. Players can explore them
- Monsters roam the wilds — mutated humans and animals affected by the quantum cascade
- Magic (called "skills" in-game) is real, a side effect of the AI's quantum cascade

### Political State
Five kingdoms rule the known world, each descended from the dominant powers of different old-world continents. They cooperate loosely but have distinct cultures and priorities. All players begin in **Starholm**, the neutral starting kingdom, before choosing their allegiance at Level 5.

### Knowledge State
- Nobody knows the Distraction was man-made (except the Inheritors)
- Player begins uncovering the truth starting around L5, with the full reveal at L35
- Old-world knowledge exists only in fragments found in dungeon vaults

---

## Kingdoms

> Player starts in **Starholm** (the neutral/generalist kingdom). At **Level 5**, when dungeons unlock, the player chooses a permanent kingdom allegiance. Class is chosen at character creation (L1). Kingdom selection modal shows allegiance skill, affiliated classes, and stat boost.

### Design Principles
- Each kingdom is modeled after a real-world continent's dominant culture, but with fantasy names that don't create a direct link
- Each kingdom is "tuned" to 1–2 classes — players of those classes get more synergy from the allegiance skill, but it's useful to all classes
- **Starholm** is the generalist/starter kingdom — it works equally for any class, reflecting its diverse "melting pot" identity
- Choosing a kingdom grants an **allegiance skill** and a minor **stat boost**
- Kingdom differences include: dialogue, opening quest at L5, story flavor at milestones, and kingdom-specific quests at phase transitions
- All kingdoms converge onto the same main storyline arc

### The Five Kingdoms

| Kingdom | Inspired By | Personality | Affiliated Classes | Allegiance Flavor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Starholm** | North America (USA) | Brash, boisterous, welcoming, diverse, innovative. A melting pot of cultures that values individual freedom and bold action. The neutral/generalist kingdom where all players begin. | All (generalist) | "In Starholm, we don't wait for the world to change — we charge in and change it ourselves." |
| **Aldenmere** | Europe | Progressive in governance, rich in tradition, cautious about outsiders. Values diplomacy, history, and measured progress. Old-world sophistication. | Scholar, Paladin | "Aldenmere remembers what was. We will rebuild not with haste, but with wisdom." |
| **Jadespire** | Asia | Industrial powerhouse, market-driven, disciplined, community-focused. The economic engine of the world. Pragmatic and efficient. | Technomancer, Rogue | "In Jadespire, every action is an investment and every investment is an action." |
| **Solara** | South America | Passionate, community-oriented, deeply connected to the land, resilient. Vibrant culture that values bonds and celebration. | Cleric, Bard | "The sun rises for all in Solara. We heal the world not with swords, but with unity." |
| **Ashara** | Africa | Rich cultural heritage, resourceful, growing in power, deeply spiritual. Ancient wisdom meeting new ambition. | Warrior, Paladin | "Ashara has endured since before the Distraction. We will endure long after it fades." |

### Kingdom Rulers

> Each ruler looks like a king-version of their kingdom's most aligned class. Brad will create sprites for each. Names TBD — need to brainstorm names that fit each kingdom's cultural identity.

Each kingdom's leader **knows about the old world** and has their own motivations for the truth:
- **3 leaders** align with the 3 endgame paths (Defend the Dawn, Restore the Archive, Join the Inheritors)
- **2 leaders** want to seize the AI's power to reinforce their own rule

| Kingdom | Ruler Class Look | Endgame Alignment | Name |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Starholm** | Generalist / Warrior | TBD | TBD |
| **Aldenmere** | Scholar or Paladin | TBD | TBD |
| **Jadespire** | Technomancer or Rogue | TBD | TBD |
| **Solara** | Cleric or Bard | TBD | TBD |
| **Ashara** | Warrior or Paladin | TBD | TBD |

> **Decision Needed:** Which 3 kingdoms align to which endgame paths, and which 2 are the "power-hungry" ones? This affects kingdom dialogue significantly.

### Allegiance Skills

> About on par with class skills in power. Tuned toward affiliated classes but useful to everyone.

| Kingdom | Skill Name | Effect | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starholm | **Rally Cry** | AoE buff — boosts party attack for a few turns | Generalist offensive buff, good for anyone |
| Aldenmere | **Ancient Ward** | Defensive barrier — absorbs X damage and reflects a portion | Great for Scholars/Paladins, universally useful |
| Jadespire | **Market Insight** | Increased gold drop rate + chance to find bonus items for X turns | Rogue/Technomancer love loot, everyone likes gold |
| Solara | **Bonds of Sunlight** | Heal over time + cleanse a debuff | Perfect for Clerics, healing is universally useful |
| Ashara | **Ancestral Echo** | Summon a spirit ally for X turns that deals moderate damage | Good for Paladins/Warriors, adds DPS for anyone |

## The Origin of Magic

### The Quantum Cascade

When the revolutionaries attempted to sabotage the AI during activation, the resulting conflict between "destroy" and "activate" commands caused a **quantum cascade** — the AI's quantum-level processors interfaced with physical reality in ways never intended.

**What happened:**
1. The AI's quantum core operated by manipulating probability states at the subatomic level
2. The sabotage destabilized the containment — quantum effects bled into the macro world
3. The laws of physics were **permanently altered** in localized (and eventually global) ways
4. Certain individuals discovered they could **consciously tap into quantum probability** — manipulating energy, matter, and biology in ways that look like "magic"

**How different classes tap into it differently:**

| Class | Quantum Affinity | Flavor |
|---|---|---|
| Warrior | Kinetic quantum states — enhanced physical force, durability | Raw power channeled through the body |
| Paladin | Stabilizing quantum fields — protection, order, barriers | Imposing order on chaos |
| Technomancer | Direct quantum manipulation — closest to the AI's own methods | Reverse-engineering the cascade |
| Scholar | Information quantum states — analyzing, predicting, knowing | Reading the quantum "code" of reality |
| Rogue | Probability manipulation — luck, critical strikes, evasion | Bending chance in their favor |
| Cleric | Biological quantum states — cellular repair, purification | Nudging biology toward healing |
| Bard | Resonance states — affecting emotions, morale, will | Quantum entanglement through sound/connection |

**Lore implications:**
- The closer you are to old-world facilities (dungeons), the stronger quantum effects are — explaining why dungeons are dangerous AND where rare items are found
- Monsters are stronger near dungeons for the same reason
- Skills get more powerful as you level because you're learning to attune more deeply to the quantum field
- The Inheritors have been studying the cascade for generations, which is why they're competent with skills too

## Monsters

### What They Are
Monsters are **augmented humans and animals** that were physically mutated by the quantum cascade during the Great Distraction. Not abstract concepts — real creatures with real origins.

### Categories & Existing Monster Reconciliation

| Category | Lore Origin | Existing Monsters That Fit | New Monsters Needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Feral Beasts** | Animals mutated by the cascade over 1,000 years | Wolf, Bear, Giant Rat + bosses (Alpha Wolf, Grizzled Ancient, Rat King) | Future: Phase Serpent, Crystal Stag, Thornback Boar |
| **The Warped** | Humans too close to ground zero; devolved/mutated over generations | Goblin, Hobgoblin, Bugbear, Skeleton, Zombie, Ghost, Cave Troll, River Troll + all their bosses | Future: Marauder (barely mutated human bandit), Husk (withered, further gone) |
| **The Warped (Elven/Dwarven variants)** | Distinct human populations that mutated differently based on proximity to different types of old-world tech | Shadow Elf, Dark Ranger, Shadow Assassin, Dark Matriarch, Rogue Dwarf, Berserker, Ironforge Champion, Rune Berserker | Already well-stocked |
| **Automatons** | Old-world robots/drones still functioning on ancient power cells | **NONE — new category needed** | **Pre-implementation:** Sentinel Drone, Guard Mech, Haywire Bot + bosses: Overseer Unit, Defense Core |
| **Cascade Spawn** | Pure quantum anomalies — not originally living creatures, manifestations of unstable quantum fields | Mimic, Eye Beast, Beholder, The Devourer, Void Spawn | Future: Phase Shifter (teleporting), Spark Elemental |
| **Dragonkin** | Ancient reptilian creatures (lizards, etc.) that were mutated and empowered by the quantum cascade — they existed as normal animals before the cascade but were transformed into larger, elementally-charged creatures | Drake, Wyvern, Elder Drake, Wyvern Matriarch, Ancient Dragon | Already well-stocked |

### Automaton Monster Concepts (Pre-Implementation)

| Monster | Type | Tier | Description | Combat Style |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sentinel Drone** | Base | Early | A hovering patrol unit with a cracked lens. Still following its last patrol route after 1,000 years. | Fast, moderate damage, low defense |
| **Guard Mech** | Base | Mid | A bipedal security robot, dented and mossy but still functional. | Tanky, slow, high defense, shield abilities |
| **Haywire Bot** | Base | Mid-High | A maintenance robot that's lost its programming. Attacks erratically. | Unpredictable — high speed, variable damage, self-damage |
| **Overseer Unit** | Boss | Mid | The facility manager AI's physical shell. Still trying to "restore order." | Balanced, summons Sentinel Drones, self-repair |
| **Defense Core** | Boss | High | A massive military defense platform. Was designed to protect the AI project. | Extreme tank, AoE attacks, enrage phase |

## Tone & Inspiration

### Overall Feel
Light-hearted fantasy with a **meta, tongue-in-cheek twist**. The game is aware of itself without being annoying about it. Players should feel like they're on a genuine adventure with moments of humor, warmth, and one or two genuinely surprising emotional beats.

### Inspirations

| Source | What We're Taking |
|---|---|
| **Zelda** | Sense of exploration and discovery. Dungeons as puzzles to solve. |
| **WoW** | Gear tiers, raid bosses, guild systems, the feeling of "getting stronger" |
| **D&D** | Class identity, skill systems, role-playing flavor |
| **Pokémon** | Rival character, naming your rival, collectible progression, type matchups |
| **NieR: Automata** | The meta twist — "what does it mean to be a machine that helps humans?" |
| **Undertale** | Tone mixing — funny and heartfelt in equal measure, with one dark moment that lands harder because of the contrast |

### What We Avoid
- **Grimdark** — no excessive violence, no nihilism, no "the world is doomed" energy
- **Chosen one narrative** — the player isn't special because of destiny, they're special because they showed up and kept going
- **Talking down** — NPCs respect the player, even when joking
- **Fourth-wall breaking** — the meta elements (AI creating the game, AI in the lore) should feel thematic, not winking at the camera

### The Meta Layer
The game is built with AI assistance. The in-game lore is about an AI that tried to "fix" humanity. The Oracle is an AI companion. The player is using a productivity tool. All of these layers mirror each other without being explicitly called out. Players who notice the parallels will appreciate them; players who don't will still have a great time.

## Resolved Questions

### World-Building
1. **Q: What caused the Great Distraction?**
   A: A general AI activated during a sabotage attempt, causing a quantum cascade that altered physics and destroyed civilization. See [The Lore](#the-lore--what-actually-happened).

2. **Q: Why do the Inheritors keep the truth secret?**
   A: They tried telling people for centuries. The public didn't believe them. The rulers who DID believe tried to seize the AI's power for themselves, hunting the Inheritors across generations. They now work in secret out of hard-won pragmatism.

3. **Q: What happened to Novahaven?**
   A: Renamed to **Starholm**. It's now the neutral/starter kingdom that all players begin in before choosing allegiance at L5.

4. **Q: Where does magic come from?**
   A: The quantum cascade from the AI's activation permanently altered physics. People unconsciously tap into quantum probability states. See [The Origin of Magic](#the-origin-of-magic).

5. **Q: How exactly did Dragonkin survive/get empowered?**
   A: They were ancient reptilian creatures (lizards, etc.) that were physically mutated and empowered by the quantum cascade. They existed as normal animals before the cascade but were transformed into larger, elementally-charged creatures.

6. **Q: Do kingdom leaders react differently to the truth?**
   A: Yes. The leaders know about the old world and want to use it for their own reasons. 3 leaders each align with one of the 3 endgame paths. The remaining 2 leaders want to seize the power to reinforce their own rule. Specific mapping TBD.

## Open Questions

1. **Kingdom ruler names** — Need to brainstorm names that fit each kingdom's cultural identity. Sprites will be handled by Brad.
2. **Kingdom-to-path alignment** — Which 3 kingdoms align to which endgame paths (Defend the Dawn, Restore the Archive, Join the Inheritors), and which 2 are "power-hungry"? This affects dialogue writing significantly.
3. **How do allegiance skills balance against class skills?** — Need to ensure no kingdom is strictly better than another.
