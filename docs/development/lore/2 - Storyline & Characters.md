## Storyline Structure

### Three Parallel Tracks

```
Level:  1----5--------12--------20--------28--------36--37------40
        |    |         |         |         |         |   |       |
Track 1:|<-Initiate->|                                           |
        |    |                                                   |
Track 2:|    |<-------- Kingdom Main Quest (Phases 1-4) -------->|<-Endgame->|
        |    |         |         |         |         |   |       |
Track 3:|<---------------------- Guild Side Quest (L1-40) ------>|
```

| Track | Name | Levels | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Initiate** | Tutorial / Training | L1–5 | Learn the basics. Class selection (L1), first quests, no kingdom yet. Simple "prove yourself" tasks. |
| **Kingdom** | Main Quest | L5–36, Endgame L37–40 | The core story. Item collection, lore reveals, dungeon unlocks, NPC dialogues, the twist, the choice. |
| **Guild** | Side Quest | L1–40 | Productivity-focused. Optional but rewarding. Special gear sets. Real-world task motivation. |

### Sub-Storylines
- **Guild storyline (L1–40):** Side quest track, productivity-focused, gear set rewards
- **Initiate storyline (L1–5):** Tutorial/onboarding before the real adventure begins
- **Kingdom storyline (L5–36/37):** Main quest — the artifact search, lore, the twist
    - Each kingdom leader has their own motivations regarding the truth (see [[1 - World Lore & Kingdoms#Kingdom Rulers]])

## Main Quest — The Kingdom Storyline (L5–36)

### Core Framing
All factions in the world are searching for old-world artifacts in general — anything from the time before the cataclysm is considered valuable and potentially powerful. The player is one of many artifact hunters. They just happen to stumble upon something **extremely useful and relevant** in their first dungeon: a strange device that turns out to be far more important than anyone realizes.

This isn't a "chosen one" narrative — it's "right place, right time, and smart enough to keep going."

### The Oracle — Your Companion

In the player's **first dungeon at L5**, they discover a strange device embedded in the dungeon wall — a **Holo Projector**. When touched, it activates. A flickering, glitchy holographic figure appears: the **Oracle**.

The Oracle is an old-world assistant AI — think of a really basic Siri/Alexa that survived the purge because it was **too simple and too stupid** to be considered a threat by the general AI. It was a building assistant, nothing more. But in a world where all smart technology is gone, even a basic AI seems miraculous.

**The Oracle's state:**
- Its memory is severely fractured — it doesn't know what it is or what happened
- It knows it was "waiting for someone"
- It becomes the player's companion/guide, projecting from the device they now carry
- As the player collects **Memory Shards** (Phase 1), its memory slowly restores
- It gives hints about what other components exist, but it gets things wrong sometimes because its memory is corrupted
- At Phase 4 completion, its final memory module is restored and it can show the full truth

**The Oracle's personality:** Helpful but confused. Occasionally says things that are anachronistic or funny ("I'm detecting elevated stress levels. Have you tried... what was it called... a 'vacation'?"). Light-hearted, supportive, a little clueless. Players should grow attached to it.

**The Oracle's portrait:** Brad will create a sprite for the Oracle.

### Phase Overview

| Phase | Levels | Artifact Collected | What It Actually Is | Story Focus | Dungeon Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0** | 5 (first dungeon) | Holo Projector (1 piece) | Holographic display unit | Finding the Oracle. It activates and becomes your companion. | Tier 1 |
| **Phase 1** | 5–12 | "Memory Shards" (25 pieces) | RAM / storage modules | Restoring the Oracle's memory. Each shard returns a fragment of dialogue/lore. The Oracle starts remembering things — hints about the old world, what the other components might be. | Tier 1 |
| **Phase 2** | 13–20 | "Conduit Threads" (25 pieces) | Wiring / cables / connectors | Restoring the Oracle's connectivity. It can now "sense" nearby old-world devices. It leads you to deeper vaults. Meeting the rival, who's getting stronger. | Tier 2 |
| **Phase 3** | 21–28 | "Resonance Plates" (25 pieces) | Circuit boards | Restoring the Oracle's processing power. It starts analyzing the data from Phase 1, making connections, getting smarter. Kingdom politics intensify. A betrayal. | Tier 3 |
| **Phase 4** | 29–36 | "The Oracle Lens" (25 pieces) | Full display / screen | Restoring the Oracle's visual output. When complete, it can show full holographic playback of old-world recordings. **This is the grand reveal.** The Oracle shows you the truth: the AI project, the revolutionaries, the cascade. Everything you thought you knew is wrong. | Tier 4 |
| **Endgame** | 37–40 | Path-specific final artifact | CPU / power source (varies by path) | The Choice — choose your path, collect the final component, confront the source | Tier 5 |

> **The grand reveal:** The collected artifacts combine into a **computer**. Not a magical artifact — a machine. The Oracle itself IS the computer, and you've been rebuilding it piece by piece without realizing it. The Holo Projector was its output device, and now it's complete.

### What the Collected Artifacts Actually Are (Obscured → Revealed)

> The player collects these without knowing what they're building. Each phase's items are disguised with fantasy-sounding names but are actually computer components.

| Phase | Fantasy Name | What It Actually Is | Clue Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Holo Projector** | Holographic display unit | Obvious in hindsight — "holo" is right there, but means nothing in a fantasy context |
| 1 | **Memory Shards** | RAM / storage modules | Medium — they "store" the Oracle's memories |
| 2 | **Conduit Threads** | Wiring / cables / connectors | Medium — they carry energy/signal between things |
| 3 | **Resonance Plates** | Circuit boards | Subtle — flat plates with etched patterns, described as "humming with energy" |
| 4 | **The Oracle Lens** | Display / screen components | Higher — an "oracle" that shows visions, a "lens" to see through |
| Final | **Core Spark** / varies by path | CPU / power source | Fully revealed — it's explicitly the processor |

### Story Beats

| Level | Event | Description | Reward |
|---|---|---|---|
| **5** | **Kingdom Selection** | Player chooses a kingdom. Ruler sends them on their first real mission into a dungeon vault. Tutorial is over — the real adventure begins. | Allegiance skill, stat boost, Phase 1 tracking unlocked |
| **5** | **The Oracle Awakens** | First dungeon — player finds the Holo Projector. The Oracle activates, confused and fragmented. It asks for help. Guaranteed 2–3 Memory Shard drops from the boss room. | Holo Projector + 2–3 Memory Shards + dungeon-specific lore |
| **~8** | **First Rival Encounter** | The recurring rival shows up — bumbling, clearly inexperienced, trying to steal an artifact you just found. Comic relief. They trip, drop a smoke bomb on themselves, escape coughing. | Flavor / foreshadowing only |
| **12** | **Phase 1 → 2 Transition** | All 25 Memory Shards collected → the Oracle's memory partially restores. It remembers fragments of the old world and hints at what else it needs. New dungeon tier unlocks. If not complete yet, remaining pieces become buyable in shop. | Phase 2 tracking begins, Tier 2 dungeons available |
| **~15** | **The Keeper's Echo** | In a Tier 2 dungeon, the player encounters a separate holographic recording (not the Oracle) — an old-world researcher. The recording explains that the artifacts are parts of something larger but the recording degrades before finishing. The Oracle reacts: "I... I think I knew them." | Unique skill or title |
| **20** | **Phase 2 → 3 Transition** | Conduit Threads assembled → the Oracle can now sense other old-world devices. It detects "something massive" buried deep. The rival shows up again — noticeably more competent, takes a piece from a dungeon before you can get there. | Phase 3 tracking, Tier 3 dungeons |
| **~22** | **The Betrayal** | A trusted NPC within your kingdom's leadership is revealed to be feeding information to the Inheritors. Kingdom-specific: could be an advisor, a guard captain, a court scholar. One-off dramatic moment — this is the single "heavy" story beat. | Major story dungeon, exclusive reward |
| **28** | **Phase 3 → 4 Transition** | Resonance Plates assembled → the Oracle is now significantly smarter, analyzing data, cross-referencing fragments. It starts saying unsettling things: "The records don't... what everyone calls [kingdom-specific cataclysm name] doesn't match what I'm finding." The rival confronts you directly — a real fight. Win or lose, they say: "You don't know what you're really building." | Phase 4 tracking, Tier 4 dungeons |
| **~32** | **The Source** | You discover a massive buried facility — an old-world data center or research lab. Inside: server racks, terminals, wiring. The Oracle goes quiet, then whispers: "I've been here before." | Lore entries, rare gear |
| **35–36** | **The Grand Reveal** | All 4 artifact phases assembled. The Oracle fully restores — and shows you the full truth: the AI, the revolutionaries, the quantum cascade. The Oracle reveals it was a building assistant in this very facility. It watched everything happen. Everything flips. | Endgame unlocked, The Choice presented |

---

## The Endgame — The Choice (L37–40)

> At L35-36, the player learns the full truth. At L37, they're presented with **The Choice** — which determines the final few levels of gameplay and the ending. **The choice is permanent.** The game is designed to be replayed, so players can experience different paths on different playthroughs.

### Path Options

| Path | Name | Philosophy | Final Artifact (25 pieces) | Ending |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Path A** | **Defend the Dawn** | The old world was the real distraction. The AI was right in principle, wrong in method. Destroy the computer to ensure it can never be rebuilt. Keep the current world. | "Sealing Rune" | The kingdoms endure. Magic remains. The Fog lifts slightly. You're a hero of the new world. |
| **Path B** | **Restore the Archive** | Knowledge should be free. Rebuild the computer, restore the old world's knowledge (but not its worst habits). A middle path — technology AND magic coexisting. | "Core Spark" | A new renaissance begins. The kingdoms gain access to old knowledge. You're the bridge between worlds. |
| **Path C** | **Join the Inheritors** | The revolutionaries were right all along. Work with the rival faction to fully restore the AI — properly this time. Let the AI guide humanity again, but with safeguards. | "Override Key" | The AI reactivates (controlled). The Distraction is truly reversed. Magic begins to fade. You become a leader of a new world order. |

### Endgame Mechanics
- Each path has a **unique dungeon/raid** with a unique boss — different layout but similar rewards and monster difficulty
- **Custom title** based on path choice
- **Slightly different closing dialogues** to wrap the story
- Path choice is **permanent** — restart the game to try a different path
- The 25 endgame pieces are the hardest to collect (see [[4 - Game Systems#Collection System]])

### Endgame Guild Titles

> At Level 35, you earn the "Master" guild rank. After The Choice at L37, you earn a path-specific guild title with a stat boost:

| Path | Guild Title | Stat Boost | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Path A** | **Hero of the Guild** | +ATK, +DEF | You chose to fight and protect. Pure martial energy. |
| **Path B** | **Guild Ambassador** | +WIS, +INT | You chose diplomacy and knowledge. Bridge-builder between worlds. |
| **Path C** | **Guild Vanguard** | +CON, +DEX | You chose the hard, unconventional path. Survival and adaptability. |

> **Discussion Needed:** The title stat boosts are a newer idea. Need to flesh out exact numerical values and ensure they don't create balance issues at endgame. Should these be flat bonuses or percentage-based?

---

## The Recurring Rival

### Character Concept
A single recurring NPC from the Inheritors who the player encounters throughout the game. Starts as a **bumbling, inexperienced** adversary and **grows alongside the player**.

**The player names this character** — the first time the rival appears (~L8), the player is prompted to give them a name. **Text input modal, alphabetical characters only** (like naming your rival in Pokémon).

### Tone
- Think **Team Rocket energy** early on — they're not scary, they're entertaining
- Gradually becomes more competent and sympathetic
- By L28, they're a genuine threat
- By L35, they're the one who tells you the truth
- At The Choice, they become either your ally (Paths B/C) or your final challenge (Path A)

### Combat Details
- **Same class as the player** — creating a mirror-match dynamic
- **Always 3 levels higher** than the player at the time of the encounter
- **Slightly better gear** — the fights should be tough but winnable
- **Solo operative** — no squad for now (party system doesn't exist yet)

### Encounter Timeline

| Level | Encounter | Vibe |
|---|---|---|
| ~8 | First appearance — tries to steal an artifact you just found, trips over a rock, drops a smoke bomb on themselves, escapes coughing. The Oracle comments: "That person seems... not great at this." | Comedy |
| ~15 | Shows up in a Tier 2 dungeon — actually competent now. You race to the boss room. They get there first but can't beat the boss. You finish it together (sort of). Awkward. | Competitive |
| ~22 | Confronts you about the betrayal — they KNEW about the traitor in your kingdom before you did. Warning: "Things aren't what they seem. Stop blindly following your ruler." | Mysterious |
| ~28 | Full boss fight against them. Win or lose narratively, they say: "You don't know what you're really building." Then they leave you a clue. | Dramatic |
| ~35 | They find you after the grand reveal. Exhausted, conflicted. They explain the Inheritors' history — their ancestors, the sabotage, the guilt. They *want* you to understand. | Emotional |
| 37+ | **Path A:** They oppose you — final fight. Tragic. | Climactic |
| 37+ | **Path B:** They cautiously ally with you — help rebuild the Archive. Mutual respect. | Hopeful |
| 37+ | **Path C:** They fully ally with you — you join the Inheritors together. | Triumphant |

## Supporting Characters — Comic Relief NPCs

> The 20% snark characters. These NPCs provide humor, warmth, and personality across the game. They should feel like family — teasing because they care, or because they're lovable weirdos. See [[1 - World Lore & Kingdoms#The 80/20 Rule]] for tone guidance.

### The Blacksmith — "Grimjaw"
Snarky, perpetually unimpressed. Comments on your gear every time you visit.

| Progression | Example Dialogue |
|---|---|
| Early game | *"You want me to SMELT this? I wouldn't use it to prop open my door."* |
| Mid game | *"Fine. This piece isn't terrible. Don't let it go to your head."* |
| Late game | *"...I suppose you've earned a modicum of my respect. Don't tell anyone."* |

> **Delivery:** Dialogue appears inside a section of the smelting/gear modals — NOT a separate dialogue popup. Grimjaw lives in the modals the player already uses.

### Guildmaster Fennick
Lovable blowhard. Takes credit for everything. Head of the Pathfinder's Guild.

| Situation | Example Dialogue |
|---|---|
| Giving quests | *"This is a CRITICAL mission. The fate of — okay, it's organizing a supply closet, but it's AN IMPORTANT supply closet."* |
| After completions | *"As YOUR guild leader, I'd like to remind everyone that I saw potential in you from day one."* (He did not.) |
| Rank-ups | *"I personally approved this promotion. You're welcome."* |

> **Delivery:** Guild rank-up dialogues, quest assignment text. Fennick IS the guild voice.

### The Oracle — Comedy Moments
Already defined as confused/anachronistic. Leaning harder into old-world references:

| Trigger | Example Dialogue |
|---|---|
| Random battle | *"Have you considered... what did they call it... a 'performance review'? I believe it involved charts and anxiety."* |
| Riding a horse | *"You're riding a HORSE? Is that... is that alive? That seems inefficient."* |
| 50 quests done | *"You've completed 50 quests. In the old world, they would reward this with something called a 'pizza party.' I do not know what that is but it sounds mandatory."* |
| Dungeon entry | *"I'm detecting elevated stress levels. Have you tried... what was it called... a 'vacation'?"* |

### The Shopkeeper — "Merch"
Used-car-salesman energy. Overly enthusiastic about EVERYTHING.

| Situation | Example Dialogue |
|---|---|
| Browsing | *"EXCELLENT choice! This potion? Oh, you can't DO better. It's our finest— okay it's just berries in water but the PRESENTATION."* |
| Upselling | *"For just 10 more gold, I can throw in a mystery pouch. What's in it? MYSTERY. That's the point."* |
| After a big purchase | *"Thank you for your patronage! You're my favorite customer! ...Today. This hour. Don't push it."* |

> **Delivery:** Dialogue appears inside the shop modal — a speech bubble or sidebar area with Merch's sprite.

### Old Wren — Conspiracy Theorist
An elderly person who keeps showing up in bizarre locations. Always has a new conspiracy theory about the cataclysm.

| Location | Example Dialogue |
|---|---|
| Tavern | *"Mark my words — it was the BIRDS. The birds did it. Have you noticed there are no pigeons anymore? SUSPICIOUS."* |
| Dungeon entrance | *"I followed a suspicious cloud here. It was shaped like a fist. EXPLAIN THAT."* |
| Shop | *"Don't buy that potion. I heard it's made from moonlight and lies."* |
| Late game | *"I've been saying for YEARS that the old ones built thinking machines. Everyone laughed. WHO'S LAUGHING NOW?"* (Accidentally right about one thing) |

> **Delivery:** Random appearance in various modals — small chance of Old Wren popping up with a one-liner. Lightweight, flavor only.

---

## Cousin Pip — The Productivity Mirror

> A family member NPC who sends **letters** at level milestones. Not an NPC you visit — the letters arrive as dialogue entries. This mirrors the player's REAL journey with the productivity tool, progressing from gentle teasing about disorganization to genuine pride. This IS the "not chosen one" narrative made mechanical: the player is special because they showed up and kept going.

### Design Rules
- **Level-based triggers** (not quest count) — level implies productivity, and it's simpler mechanically
- **Tone starts light, not harsh** — players come from a place of disorganization, don't rub that in. Early letters are teasing, not berating.
- **Universal NPC** — not kingdom-specific. Pip is the same for all players.
- **Letters only** — no map location, no visit mechanic. Just dialogue entries that fire at milestones.

### Letter Progression

| Level | Tone | Example Letter |
|---|---|---|
| **3** | Light teasing | *"Word reached me you joined some 'adventurer's guild.' Can you adventure your way into organizing that disaster you call a bedroom?"* |
| **5** | Curious | *"So apparently you're choosing a kingdom now? Look at you, making life decisions. I'm cautiously optimistic."* |
| **8** | Skeptical surprise | *"Wait — you actually did things? MULTIPLE things? ...Did someone put you up to this?"* |
| **12** | Still in disbelief | *"Mom asked me if you were feeling okay because you've been 'so productive lately.' I told her not to panic."* |
| **15** | Genuine surprise | *"I asked around about you. People say you're... reliable now? I literally don't know how to respond to that."* |
| **18** | Warming up | *"Remember when you couldn't finish ONE thing without getting sidetracked fourteen times? ...Actually, I probably shouldn't bring that up. Old habits."* |
| **22** | Grudging pride | *"Mom says you've changed. I told her not to get excited, but... honestly? Even I'm a little impressed. Don't you DARE tell anyone I said that."* |
| **26** | Real warmth | *"I ran into someone who works with you. They said you were the most dependable person they know. I had to sit down for a minute."* |
| **30** | Emotional | *"Remember when you couldn't finish a single chore without getting distracted fourteen times? Look at you now. I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying."* |
| **34** | Pride | *"I brag about you now. I know, I know — I used to tease you. But seriously, what you've become? It's kind of amazing."* |
| **36+** | Full proud family energy | *"I used to worry about you. I don't anymore. Whatever you're doing out there — keep doing it. The world needs more people like who you've become."* |

> **Why this works for ADHD users:** The progression from "you can't finish anything" to "look at you now" mirrors the real ADHD experience with productivity tools. The snarky-to-proud arc is emotionally resonant without being heavy. It's tongue-in-cheek about productivity without breaking the fourth wall.

## Resolved Questions

### Storyline
1. **Q: What is the final assembled artifact?**
   A: A **computer**. The Oracle Holo Projector + Memory Shards + Conduit Threads + Resonance Plates + Oracle Lens = the Oracle fully restored. It IS the computer. You were rebuilding an AI this whole time.

2. **Q: Is The Choice permanent?**
   A: Yes. Restart the game for a different path.

3. **Q: Are the endgame paths mechanically different?**
   A: Similar difficulty and rewards, different dungeon layouts, bosses, and dialogue. The main difference is narrative, not mechanical advantage.

### The Rival
4. **Q: What class is the rival?**
   A: Same class as the player, 3 levels higher. Creates a mirror-match dynamic.

5. **Q: Does the rival have a squad?**
   A: No — solo operative for now. Squad encounters are a future feature (requires party system).

6. **Q: Can the player name the rival?**
   A: Yes — text input modal at the first encounter (~L8), alphabetical characters only.

7. **Q: Does the Oracle need a visual portrait or just an emoji?**
   A: Brad will create a sprite for the Oracle.

## Open Questions

1. **Endgame title stat boosts** — exact numerical values need to be defined. Flat bonus or percentage? Need to ensure balance at endgame.
2. **NPC dialogue delivery method** — Confirmed direction: embed NPC dialogue into existing modals (shop, blacksmith, guild) with sprite + speech bubble area. NOT in inventory modal. Old Wren = periodic random notification/toast. Needs a **prototype modal** to nail down layout before finalizing specifics. Flesh out after prototype.
3. **Dialogue pacing goal** — Roughly ~1 major dialogue sequence per level (not a hard rule yet). Spread different NPC arcs across levels so the player isn't hit with everything at once. Example cadence: Fennick at L1, Pip at L3, kingdom choice at L5, Pip at L6, guild at L7, etc. Will be formalized once all NPC arcs and story beats are mapped out.
