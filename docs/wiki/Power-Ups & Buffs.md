# Power-Ups & Buffs

Power-ups are temporary bonuses earned by completing tasks, maintaining streaks, and hitting milestones. They enhance your productivity by rewarding consistency and celebrating progress.

---

## How Power-Ups Work

Power-ups trigger automatically when you meet specific conditions. There's no manual activation—they just happen when you're doing well!

**The flow:**
1. Complete a task, level up, or build a streak
2. If conditions match a trigger, you earn a power-up
3. The buff appears in your status bar and applies immediately
4. It lasts until its duration expires (hours, uses, or midnight)

## Active Power-Ups Display

### Status Bar

When you have active time-limited buffs, they appear in Obsidian's status bar:

| Display | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 🩸 45m | One buff active (First Blood, 45 minutes left) |
| 🌊 3 | Multiple buffs active (first icon + count) |

**Click the status bar** to see all active buffs with their remaining durations.

### Class Perks

Your class perk is always active and displays separately on the Character Sheet. It doesn't expire and isn't shown in the status bar.

## Triggers

Triggers are the conditions that grant power-ups. Each has a **detection point**—the moment the system checks if you've earned a buff.

### Task Completion Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Grants |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **First Blood** | Complete your first task of the day | First Blood (+5% XP, 1 hour) |
| **Phoenix** | Complete a task after 3+ days inactive | Catch-Up (2x XP, 3 uses) |

### Quest Completion Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Grants |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **One-Shot** | Complete a quest directly from Available → Done | Momentum (+10% XP) |

### Streak Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Grants |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Streak Keeper (3)** | Reach a 3-day streak | Streak Shield |
| **Streak Keeper (7)** | Reach a 7-day streak | Random Tier 1 buff |

### Level & Progression Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Grants |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Level Up** | Gain a character level | Level Up! (+3 all stats, 24 hours) |
| **Tier Up** | Reach a new visual tier | Limit Break (+3 stats above cap, 24 hours) |

---

## Tiers and Rarity

Power-ups come in three tiers:

| Tier | Power Level | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **T1** | Common | First Blood, Momentum, Lucky Star |
| **T2** | Uncommon | Flow State, Streak Shield, Level Up! |
| **T3** | Rare | Limit Break |

Some triggers grant a **random buff from a tier pool** instead of a specific effect (e.g., Streak Keeper 7 rolls from T1 pool).

---

## Duration Types

Power-ups expire in different ways:

| Duration | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Hours** | Expires after X hours (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours) |
| **Uses** | Expires after N task completions (e.g., "next 3 tasks") |
| **Until Midnight** | Expires at 11:59 PM local time |
| **Until Used** | Single-use effect (e.g., Streak Shield blocks one reset) |
| **Passive** | Never expires (class perks only) |

---

## Collision Policies

What happens when you trigger a power-up you already have?

| Policy | Behavior | Examples |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Refresh** | Timer resets to full duration | First Blood, Lucky Star |
| **Stack** | Adds stacks; effects multiply | Momentum, Streak Shield |
| **Extend** | Adds more uses/time | Catch-Up |
| **Ignore** | Nothing happens | — |

> [!TIP]
> **Momentum stacks!** Each quick quest completion adds another +10% XP layer. Complete 5 one-shot quests and you're at +50% XP until midnight.

---

## Class Perks

Each class has a unique passive perk that's always active:

| Class | Perk | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| ⚔️ Warrior | Task Slayer | Completion streaks grant +5% XP |
| 🛡️ Paladin | Shield of Discipline | One missed day/week doesn't break streak |
| 💻 Technomancer | Code Warrior | Multi-day project quests grant +25% XP |

| 🗡️ Rogue | Clever Shortcut | Fast completions grant +20% bonus XP |
| ✨ Cleric | Self-Care Aura | Wellness streaks stack bonus (+5%/day) |
| 🎵 Bard | Charming Presence | Social battery recharges faster after social quests |

These appear on your Character Sheet with the class emoji.

## Tips for Maximizing Buffs

### Start Strong
Complete your first task early to get **First Blood** and benefit from +5% XP for your productive morning hours.

### Build Momentum
Knock out quick one-shot quests to stack **Momentum** buffs. Each adds +10% XP for the rest of the day.

### Protect Your Streak
At 3 days, you earn a **Streak Shield**. This forgives one missed day—but if you're a Paladin, you already get one free!

### Push Through Slumps
The **Phoenix** trigger rewards you for coming back after 3+ days away. Don't feel guilty about breaks—your return is celebrated!
