| 🟢 **Adept** | Green | 1.0× | 1-15 |

| 🟣 **Master** | Purple | 2.0× | 15-35 |
| 🟠 **Epic** | Orange | 2.5× | 25-40 |
| 🟡 **Legendary** | Gold | 3.0× | 30-40 |

### Tier Progression

Gear quality improves as you level up. Early on you'll mostly find Adept gear; late-game you'll encounter Epic and Legendary drops.

## Getting Gear

### Quest Completion

Completing quests can drop gear based on:
- **Quest Type** → affects slot (e.g., "main" quests favor Chest/Weapon/Head)
- **Quest Difficulty** → affects tier chances
- **Character Level** → affects item level

### Combat Victory

Defeating monsters in bounties or dungeons can drop gear:
- **Monster Tier** affects drop rate and quality
- **Elite/Boss** monsters have better drops

### Dungeon Chests

Chests in dungeons contain gear at the chest's tier level.

### The Store

Buy consumables (potions) with gold—gear is not purchasable.

---

## Inventory Management

Access your inventory via:
- **Command Menu → Inventory**
- **Character Sheet → Inventory button**

### Inventory Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Equip** | Wear an item (swaps with current) |
| **Unequip** | Move equipped item to inventory |
| **Sell** | Convert to gold (sell value shown) |
| **Smelt** | Combine at the Blacksmith |

---

## The Blacksmith (Smelting)

The Blacksmith lets you upgrade gear by combining items.

### How Smelting Works

1. Select **3 items of the same tier**
2. The Blacksmith produces **1 item of the next tier up**
3. Output slot depends on input:
   - **Same slot all 3** → Guaranteed same slot output
   - **Mixed slots** → Random slot from input types

### Smelting Bonuses

| Condition | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| All 3 same slot | Output guaranteed that slot |
| All 3 same tier | Upgrade to next tier |
| Mixed tiers | Output = highest input tier (no upgrade) |

### Legendary Refinement

Smelting 3 **Legendary** items produces another Legendary with:
- Potentially better stats (re-rolled)
- **Gold cost: 4,000g**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Legendary smelting is the only smelting that costs gold!

### Smelting Example

```
3× Adept Swords → 1× Journeyman Sword
3× Master Helms → 1× Epic Helm
3× Legendary items → 1× Legendary (4,000g)
```

---

## Set Bonuses

Gear dropped from quests in the **same folder** belongs to the same **set**. Equip multiple pieces for bonuses!

### How Sets Work

1. Each quest folder creates a unique set
2. Gear from that folder is tagged with the set ID
3. Equip 2, 4, or 6 pieces to activate bonuses

### Bonus Thresholds

| Pieces | Typical Bonus |
|--------|---------------|
| **2 pieces** | Minor stat bonus |
| **4 pieces** | XP or gold bonus |
| **6 pieces** | Major bonus or title |

### AI-Generated Set Bonuses

If you have Gemini AI configured, set bonuses are **thematically generated** based on the folder name. For example:

- "Fitness" folder → Strength/Constitution bonuses
- "Work Projects" folder → XP bonus for Dev category

Without AI, default bonuses are applied.

### Viewing Active Set Bonuses

Check your Character Sheet to see:
- Currently active set bonuses
- How many pieces equipped per set
- Next bonus threshold

## Sell Values

Selling gear gives gold based on tier and level:

| Tier | Base Gold | Per Level |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Common | 5 | +2 |
| Adept | 15 | +2 |
| Journeyman | 40 | +2 |
| Master | 100 | +2 |
| Epic | 250 | +2 |
| Legendary | 500 | +2 |

**Example**: A Level 20 Master item sells for 100 + (20 × 2) = **140 gold**

---

## Legendary Items

Legendary gear is special:

- **Unique names** (e.g., "The Accountant's Greataxe")
- **Custom lore text** describing the item's origin
- **Linked to origin quest** for reference
- **3.0× stat multiplier** (highest in game)

Legendary items can only drop from:
- Completing high-level quests
- Defeating boss monsters
- Opening high-tier dungeon chests

---

## Tips for Gear Management

1. **Don't hoard low-tier gear**—sell or smelt it
2. **Check class restrictions** before getting excited about drops
3. **Match 3 same-slot items** for guaranteed slot output when smelting
4. **Watch for set pieces**—folder-based sets can give significant bonuses
5. **Legendary refinement** is expensive—save gold for it
